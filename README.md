# Healthy_Programmer_Alarm

Nowadays all our work revolve around a seat. We usually have to stick around a seat to get our work done. This is actually very bad for all of us. 
So, I have created a programm which will remind a person to do day to day activities.
This programm plays a song which reminds the user to do the activity.
The following activities have been included in the program:
1) Drinking water.
2) Eye exercise.
3) Full Body exercise.
